## Message

Hey cheaters, stop looking at my stuff.  
Why are you even on my GitHub? There's a reason I privated everything.  

Some of you all have too much free time if you're looking at my GitHub.

-  Stop gaslighting and lying.  
-  Please seek help — some of you clearly need it.  
-  You all need to properly **communicate**.  
-  No more "crab in the bucket" mentality.  
-  If you constantly need to make deals, maybe you don't have much **trust or knowledge** to begin with.
-  Some of you all need to stop meddling in other poeple's businesses when it doens't concern you
-  Stop overinterpreting/under everything
